Welcome to Unity Intermediate Project!   
This project uses functions such as `Drag and Shoot` to throw an object, `Save Data`, and `Fade in/out`...   
First, you don't need any physical formulas because Unity supports this enviroment.   
Unity's physics environment includes `AddForce`, which makes game development easier!     

You can also practice with Unity Beginner Level Project [here](https://github.com/pip-izony/Jelly_Balls).
