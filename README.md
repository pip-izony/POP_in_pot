# Hello
# Welcome to my game project using Unity.
# My game project has functions that drag and shoot process for throwing object, save data, fade in/out.
# First, you don't need any physical formula because Unity supports physical enviroment.
# (Tip : If you need to your own physical enviroment, you should use fomula such as X = Velocity*cosθ*Time, Y = Velocity*sinθ*Time - 1/2*Gravity*Time*Time.)
# The physical enviroment of Unity has AddForce, so you can easily make any game!
