# Hello

# Welcome to my game project using Unity.

# My game project has functions such as dragging and shooting to throw an object, saving data, and fading in/out, etc...

# First, you don't need any physical formula because Unity supports this enviroment.

# (Tip : If you need to make your own physical enviroment, you can use fomula such as X = VelocitycosθTime, Y = VelocitysinθTime - 1/2GravityTime*Time.)

# The physical enviroment of Unity has AddForce, so you can easily make any game!

# You can find this project on Google Play Store or click this link below ▼
