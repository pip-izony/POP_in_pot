Welcome to my game project using Unity.   
   
My game project has functions such as dragging and shooting to throw an object, saving data, and fading in/out, etc...   
First, you don't need any physical formula because Unity supports this enviroment.   
(If you need to make your own physical enviroment, you can use fomula such as X = VelocitycosθTime, Y = VelocitysinθTime - 1/2GravityTime*Time.)   
The physical enviroment of Unity has AddForce, so you can easily make any game!
